Add support for multiple files at once - batch conversion
Allow saving all files to one folder automatically - default download directory? maybe either root folder or rather /Downloads (or ask user to decide)
Quality slider - adjust compression/quality settings - how? if...quality vector


What conversion types do I want?
Separate conversions from compressions? Possible? Plausible?

**! CONVERSION TYPES !!**

png/jpeg - ico
ico - png/jpeg

pdf - png/jpeg
jpeg/png - pdf
svg - png/jpeg
png/jpeg - svg

png - jpeg - DONE
jpeg - png - DONE

pdf shrink
word to pdf
pdf to word


-----------------------

resize on convert - can I always compress the file when converting?

--------------------------

readme button with supported formats? or some other way to show what program can do





* pip install -r requirements.txt

If converting to .ico - first convert .jpg (or whatever format you have) to .png as .jpg doesn't support transparency which is often needed for .ico


- while converting, add better suffix - e.g. "converted_ico" to show the format even if extension is hidden
- add .ico to .jpg and .png conversions (or maybe only png due to transparency)
